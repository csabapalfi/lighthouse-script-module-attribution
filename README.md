# lighthouse-script-module-attribution

See [GoogleChrome/lighthouse#9200](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/9200) and [GoogleChrome/lighthouse#8526](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/8526)

Lighthouse doesn't attribute JS execution time to ES modules until it starts to also rely on the sampling profiler in Chrome.
